# EthereumValuePredictor
This project is done as an assignment for a course named "Python for finance". 
We tried to get a regression model to predict the value of the Ethereum coin in dollars. 
For that, we will gather data based on the relative interest people have for the subject on Google, we will also try to get a feeling of how are people actually reacting 
to ethereum with a sentiment analysis, based on the most retweeted tweets daily.

If you want to check the project out, click on the jupyter notebook of this repo.

If it is of any interest, we also added all the datasets we created for this project to come through, you can reuse them however you want.
